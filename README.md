# sudoku

Sudoku game in Javascript.
Play at [http://www.daanmichiels.com/sudoku](http://www.daanmichiels.com/sudoku).


## Mobile version

The game is currently not usable on mobile. It requires a physical keyboard.
This may change in the future.


## The docs/ folder

The actual code can be found in the `docs` folder.
Though this folder is typically used for documentation, it is the only folder
that can be used as the web-published version of a project by GitHub Pages.
(It is also possible to use a github-pages branch, but this is more complicated.)

Advantages of this approach:
 - simple
 - clean web-published folder

Disadvantages:
 - `docs` is a counterintuitive name
 - all code in `docs` is ignored for the language statistics of this GitHub project;
   in particular, GitHub says this project is Batchfile and Python,
   but almost all of it is Javascript.
